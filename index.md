Metadata 4 DKG 2022
===================

This workshop is part of the [COST Action on Distributed Knowledge Graphs (DKG)](https://cost-dkg.eu/).
It will be held from Wednesday 18 May until Friday 20 May at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Lyon, France.

In this workshop, we will try to find a consensus on a Knowledge Graph (KG) metadata scheme,
demo and assess the available tools for such metadata capturing in a KG-compliant
manner, and start applying these insights on actual KG datasets.

## Registration

All participants of our COST Action are invited to join this workshop, and we are open for other
participants as well. If you would like to join, get in touch with Tobias Kuhn (t.kuhn@vu.nl), so
we can send you an invitation via COST. COST covers travel and accomodation costs.

The joint sessions on the first and last days can be followed remotely. All other sessions are only
accessible to physical participation.
