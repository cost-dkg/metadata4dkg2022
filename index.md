Metadata 4 DKG 2022
===================

This workshop will be held from Wednesday 18 May (noon) until Friday 20 May (noon) in Lyon, France.

In this workshop, we will try to find a consensus on a Knowledge Graph (KG) metadata scheme,
demo and assess the available tools for such metadata capturing in a KG-compliant
manner, and start applying these insights on actual KG datasets.
