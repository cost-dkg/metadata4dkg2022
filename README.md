Metadata Authoring for Distributed Knowledge Graphs - Workshop 2022
===================================================================

This workshop will be help 18-20 May in Lyon.

In this workshop, we will try to find a consensus on a Knowledge Graph (KG) metadata scheme,
demo and assess the available tools for such metadata capturing in a KG-compliant
manner, and start applying these insights on actual KG datasets.
